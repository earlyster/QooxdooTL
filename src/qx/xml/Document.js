/**
 * Cross browser XML document creation API
 * 
 * The main purpose of this class is to allow you to create XML document objects in a
 * cross-browser fashion. Use create to create an empty document,
 * fromString to create one from an existing XML text. Both methods
 * return a native DOM object. That means you use standard DOM methods on such
 * an object (e.g. createElement).
 * 
 * The following links provide further information on XML documents:
 * 
 * 
 * W3C Interface Specification
 * MS xml Object
 * MSXML GUIDs and ProgIDs
 * MDN Parsing and Serializing XML
